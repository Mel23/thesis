%%% CHANGE TO MNTHESIS CLASS'S DEFINITION OF XFLOATS.
%%% 
%%% This change allowed me to use the deluxetable environment, which is what
%%% my Tables were (already) made in for the AJ articles.  One of the tables
%%% is both rotated and contains footnotes, which deluxetable can do but
%%% which the other table environment included by default in the MN thesis
%%% template could not handle.
%%%
%%% I learned this fix from:
%%% 		http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/191808/problems-with-tikz-when-i-change-document-class
%%%
%%% save a copy of the kernel's \@xfloat
\makeatletter\let\latex@xfloat\@xfloat\makeatother
%%%
%%% load the mnthesis class
\documentclass[11pt,oneside]{mnthesis}
%%%
%%% fix floats to use single spacing
\usepackage{etoolbox}
\makeatletter
\let\@xfloat\latex@xfloat
\apptocmd{\@xfloat}{\linespread{1}\normalsize}{}{}
